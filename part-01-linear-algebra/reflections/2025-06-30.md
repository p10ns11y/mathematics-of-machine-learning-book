### Part 1: Linear Algebra

In Machine learning context, it represents data representation and manipulation.


#### Chapter 1: Vectors and Vector Spaces

It had strikingly explained that how the mathematical topics covered 
In the book are relevant to Machine Learning. 

  - `Linear algebra` explains the mathematical concepts and models behind `data and data manipulation`
  - `Calculus` explains how to fit the data (which existing function fits the data or approximation or simplification)
  - `Probability` gives insights and interpretation of the data.

**The book** 
  - uses classic python machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, pandas and so on.
  - uses Iris dataset (`data`) and beautifully connected the dataset with `matrix` (150 species rows and 4 feature columns)
  where each row tuple represents `vectors` which is the interest of this chapter. 
  So what? when the data is transformed into `matrix` or `vectors` (eventually programable data structure)
  The mathematical operations can be done (such as translations, transformations and scaling and squeezing, simplifications in the context of vectors) and it helps removing redundancies, leads to insightful visualization

**I have learned:**
  - Formal defintions of vector spaces `(V, F, +, .)`. 
    It reminded me of the concept of `Groups` (Modern Algebra), 
    (commutativity, associtivity, null vector, additive inverse and so on, multiplicative distributivity)
  - Linear combinations, Independence/dependence
  - Span (~~maximally independent subset of the given~~ vector space that contains any possible vectors of the given space, ie., all possible linear combination of set of vectors of given vector space `(V, F, +, .)`)
  - Basis (_maximally independent subset_ of vectors that can generate any vector of the given vector space)

### Grok evaluation

**Score: 6/10**

**Reasoning**: You have a solid conceptual overview and understand the relevance of linear algebra to machine learning. However, your reflection lacks depth in examples, problem-solving, and precise definitions. Demonstrating these would push your score higher.

#### Breakdown:

- Conceptual Understanding: 7/10 (good grasp but vague definitions)
- Application to Machine Learning: 8/10 (clear context but lacks specific techniques)
- Problem-Solving and Examples: 4/10 (no examples or problems provided)
- Self-Reflection and Gaps: 5/10 (no questions or identified weaknesses)
